## Team Collaboration Document

# How will we tackle the homework? 

We will meet everyweek after class, to discuss week per week how we will work. We will divide tasks, work on it by ourselves and then review each others work 

# Branches off main? Who reviews pull requests? 

Each person will create a branch for each task that they are working on. Once a member completes their task, they will send a pull request from their branch to the main. Another member of the team will review the pull request to check that there are no conflicts. After the pull request got accepted and the task is merged into main, all members will pull from the main into their own branches, so that all the work is in sync. Once a branch for a specific task has been merged into main, and all members have pulled the changes, the specific branch will be deleted so that the repo will remain clean.

# Will you meet physically or virtually>
