## Team Collaboration Document

# How will we tackle the homework? 

We will meet everyweek after class, to discuss week per week how we will work. We will divide tasks, work on it by ourselves and then review each others work 

# Branches off main? Who reviews pull requests? 

We will create 3 branches: one for Tessa and one for Kali and one for Benni. We will each work in our own branches and push to the main from there. Since we are only two, the other person (whoever did not push) will accept the pull request. 

# Will you meet phycially or virtually> 

Both physically and virtually, depending on how are weekly schedules look like

# How do you communicate? Team chat on Slack? 

WhatsApp.
