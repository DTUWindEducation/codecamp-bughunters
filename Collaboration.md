# How will we tackle the homework? 

tessa 

# Branches off main? Who reviews pull requests? 

We will create two branches: one for Tessa and one for Kali. We will each work in our own branches and push to the main from there. Since we are only two, the other person (whoever did not push) will accept the pull request.
